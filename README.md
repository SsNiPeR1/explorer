# Explorer

<b>THE PROJECT IS UNMAINTAINED, PLEASE USE OTHER STABLE EXPLORERS.</b>

So, I disliked how other Ethereum explorers were hard to set up and use, and I wished to create another one, with simplicity in setup in mind.

I hope you will like it, because everything you need to set is coin name (ETH for Ethereum, ETC for Ethereum classic, etc.) and its RPC URL (https://www.ethercluster.com/etc for Ethereum Classic)

Now it is set up, you can just enter any Ether address, transaction hash or block number and it will find it and show. If it is invalid (wrong length or not starting with "0x"), it will say that the input is malformed.

If you find any bugs, report them to me please in issues tab.
